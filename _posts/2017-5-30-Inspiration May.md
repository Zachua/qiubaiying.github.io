## Inspiration 5/30

- It is true that I do not like to work. But remember the time that I had nothing to do on work, I feel nervous inside and am on the lay-off edge. It is worse than too busy. If I am busy, I still have the chance to get balance and the connection between myself with others and the world. If I have nothing to do, I feel lonely and isoloated to the world. That is the terrible feeling.

- In addtion, I hate to be busy with trivial things. As a result, I can not foucus and have limited personal time. I am just like one small screw on the Eiffel towel. The more busy, the worse I feel. I feel abandon by others and the world.

## Inspiration 5/30

- It is true that I do not like to work. But remember the time that I have nothing to do, I feel nervous inside and I am on the edge of laying off. 
That is worse than I am too busy. If I am busy, I can still find ways to rest and find the connection between myself with others and the world. I have nothing to do, I feel I am lonely and isoloated to the world. That is
the terrible feeling I have. I wish I can get rid of them. 
- I have to be too busy with trivial things. I may have too much to worry and do not have personal time. I am just like one small screw on the Eiffel towel. The more busy I am, the worse I feel. I feel I am abandon by others and the world.
